This project is built using Node.js with the Express.js framework. It also uses Passport/Passport Local for user authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, along with express sessions and flash to flash error messages for incorrect logins. All of the users data along with their associated clients will be stored in a MongoDB database. First the user will need to sign up entering their name, email, and password. They will be redirected to the login page where they will login using the email and password they signed up with. Then they will be taken to the main page, that being the Client Tracker page. On that page, the user will be able to add clients to the client list as well as update their clients information and/or delete them from the list. This is a website useful for keeping track of clients for freelancers.

## Optimizations

If/when I improve this project, I would like to allow the user to delete their account if they choose, as well as change their password if they were to ever forget it. I also would like to make this project a bit more responsive.

## Lessons Learned

I learned how to create a user sign up/login system using Passport/Passport Local for authenticating users. I also learned how to build a fully functional crud app.
